# norlab_basler_camera_driver

Simple ros driver for basler camera. The available launch file is for two hardware synchronized cameras (i.e., stereo setup).

The saved parameters in each camera are available in [config/working_configs_pylonviewer](https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/norlab_basler_camera_driver/tree/master/config/workin_configs_pylonviewer), where camera1 is the **controller** and camera2 is the **responder**.
